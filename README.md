# Badger Book

**Badger Book** is a web-based student directory application built with vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap. It dynamically displays student profiles from an API, allows users to search by name, major, and interests, and offers responsive design and interactive filtering.

**Disclaimer:** This project was originally developed as part of a university course (CS571 at UWâ€“Madison). Some functionality (like the data-fetching endpoint) requires a valid CS571 Badger ID and will not function outside the course environment. This repository is for **educational and demonstration purposes only**.
