# Badger Book

**Badger Book** is a web-based student directory application built with vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap. It dynamically displays student profiles from an API, allows users to search by name, major, and interests, and offers responsive design and interactive filtering.

  **Disclaimer:** This project was originally developed as part of a university course (CS571 at UW–Madison). Certain features (like the data-fetching endpoint) require authentication to CS571 course APIs and will **not function outside the course environment**. This repository is for **demonstration and learning purposes only**.
